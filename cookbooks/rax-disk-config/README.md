rax-disk-config
===============

This cookbook depends on the community `lvm` cookbook. It will find all
unmounted and unformatted disks and configure them. This cookbook is meant for
use on Rackspace Performance Cloud servers. There may be one or more
unformatted or mounted disks with larger flavors in the Performance2 category.
